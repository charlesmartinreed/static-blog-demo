### Dynamic Routes

- Filename should look like this `[dynamicname].js`, in the pages folder.

### Deploy

- Run `yarn build`, add `"export": "next export"` command to package.json and then run `yarn export` as well.
- You can test your site locally by running the command `npx serve` and pointing it at the output folder generated by the build command, e.g., `npx serve out/`
